    "\n",
    "1. Analysing fluorescent digital slides, which can help quantitate the area of staining of a particular biomarker.\n",

    "  - What is the average intensity of a biomarker staining throughout the sample? \n",

As these images are matrices, we can do many of the same mathematical operations on images as we do on matrices. However, we don't want to manually generate every image by populating a matrix. This means that we will have to have some manner of interacting with image files on our computer, programmatically. \n",

    "If you have done the above exercise of using **stardist** to perform segmentation for the cytoplasm channel, then you may have noticed pecularities. These can be justified by StarDist really only being designed for accurate segmentation of nuclei. However, if you are interested in cytoplasm segmentation, then using **cellpose** is better suited for this application. This Python package is more specialised, and better apllied to cell and nucleus segmentation. After completing this workshop, you will observe that **stardist** and **cellpose** both work in a similar fashion. For more information and documentation, please follow this [link](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose).\n",

    "In undertaking this workshop, we have learned to import, explore and analyse fluorescence microscopy images, and how to perform some basic image analyses using several packages, in Python. We have also learned how to perform clustering analyses, through implementing unsupervised machine learning algorithms (GMM). Further to this, we provided an introduction into the use of deep learning algorithms for use in nuclei segmentation, which can provide a fast, accurate and powerful count of the nuclei present in an image; this can be invaluable for analysing large amounts of data. Following the guided links, you can start to explore more advanced image analysis techniques, and *Learn To Discover* how these can help you further your own work, and reserach.\n",
