    "1. Analysing fluorescent digital slides, which can help to quantify the area of staining of a particular biomarker.\n",

    "  - What is the average intensity of a biomarker staining throughout the sample? \n",

    "These indices, more commonly called pixels, are a measure of how many photons hit that particular position on the camera sensor. As these images are matrices, we can do many of the same mathematical operations on images as we do on matrices. However, we don't want to manually generate every image by populating a matrix. This means that we will have to have some manner of interacting with image files on our computer, programmatically. \n",

    "As an example, we can use functions to flexibly rescale our image data. This helps to enhance visibility of features that are limited to a narrow range of intensities. Mathematical normalisation can be performed on whole images, or with respect to a single channel. In the following example, we normalise the whole image with respect to channel 1. To do so, we calculate the mean and standard deviation of the pixel intensities of channel 1, clip the image to plus / minus the values obtained (which preserves most of the intensities) and then rescale the result to values between 0 and 255 for full image resolution.\n",

    "If you have done the above exercise of using **stardist** to perform segmentation for the cytoplasm channel, then you may have noticed some peculiarities. These can be justified by StarDist being designed for accurate segmentation of nuclei. However, if you are interested in cytoplasm segmentation, then using **cellpose** is better suited for this application. This Python package is more specialised, and better applied to cell and nucleus segmentation. After completing this workshop, you will observe that **stardist** and **cellpose** both work in a similar fashion.

    "In undertaking this workshop, we have learned to import, explore and analyse fluorescence microscopy images, and how to perform some basic image analyses using several packages, in Python. We have also learned how to perform clustering analyses, through implementing unsupervised machine learning algorithms (GMM). Further to this, we provided an introduction into the use of deep learning algorithms for use in nuclei segmentation, which can provide a fast, accurate and powerful count of the nuclei present in an image; this can be invaluable for analysing large amounts of data. Following the guided links, you can start to explore more advanced image analysis techniques, and *Learn To Discover* how these can help you further your own work, and research.\n",
